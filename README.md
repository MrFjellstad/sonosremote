# sonosremote
Start the Sonos player when you arrive at home.

Works with https://ifttt.com/applets/57585804d-play-sonos-when-arriving-home to start your Sonos player when you arrive at home.

It works as a replacement for the python script and Dropbox installation needed by the IFTTT task. It was made so I could have it running on my Raspberry Pi.
